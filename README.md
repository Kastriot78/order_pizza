            The website was build for a pizza delivery business.When we go to home page, or to menu we can see a lot of pizzas and then we can start order pizzas,
            when we add a pizza to cart we will see a notification(Product added to shopping cart).User cannot add same product twice on the cart.User can click to card,
            where there is a button quick view where he can all details about that pizza.When we go to cart we can see all of our products that we added to cart, and user can
            increase and decrease quantity of products.And then if user clicks on order now button, he will see a form where he should fill that form with personal information
            and than he can see that his order is on the way.
